        <h2>Topic: The Border</h2>
        <p>Today I am here to address the American border crisis. I believe this border crisis is manageable, but the president needs to take the reins to do so. Trump identified the problem previously and addressed it with the wall's construction. This is not nearly enough. The border has semi-truck-sized tunnels running below it that the cartel uses to have easy access to the US. Finishing the construction of the wall won't prevent these actions. We need to use our own military to enforce our borders to prevent all paths of illegal entry into our land. My goal is to protect our homeland first. Upgrade our missile defense systems. Upgrade our cybersecurity. Upgrade our border security.  </p>
