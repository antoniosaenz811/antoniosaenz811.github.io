        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
        <p>Vivek Ramaswamy was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to Indian-Hindu immigrant parents on August 9th, 1985. He classifies himself as an American entrepreneur, as he founded Roivant Sciences (a pharmaceutical company) in 2014, and is currently a presidential candidate for the Republican party ever since he declared candidacy back in February 2023. Ramaswamy has been on top of his academics ever since he was a kid. He was his high-school's valedictorian, graduated Harvard with a degree in biology, and later earned a JD from Yale Law school. In his early career, Ramaswamy used his smarts to become a big-time entrepreneur. Ramaswamy and Travis May co-founded the Campus Venture Network, which provided a private social networking website for students who strived to start a business (Zuckerberg 2.0). 2 years later, Ramaswamy sold the company. Ramaswamy then worked at a hedge fund called QVT Financial from 2007-2014. Ramaswamy co-managed the company’s biotech portfolio, and was in charge of managing investments from companies including Palatin Technologies, Concert Pharmaceuticals, Pharmassett, and Martin Shkreli’s Retrophin. After his time at QVT, Ramaswamy founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences. The goal here was for Roivant to buy patents from larger pharmaceutical companies for drugs that had not been developed yet, and bring them to the market successfully. In 2015, Ramaswamy raised $360 million for the Roivant subsidiary Axovant Sciences, in an attempt to market the drug intepirdine as a solution for Alzheimer's disease. Ramaswamy was on the cover of Forbes, flaunting the ROI of his company, and Axovant became huge on Wall Street. Ramaswamy sold Axovant to Viking Global Investors and claimed over $37 million in capital gains. However, in 2017, the company’s value plummeted, and Ramaswamy got blamed for much of the losses. Ramaswamy claimed he had no regrets with how they handled the drug, and continued his business with Roivant, soon selling stakes that granted Roivant $175 million in capital gains. Ramaswamy has also participated in activism and strives for asset management. In 2022, Vivek, along with his high-school friend Anson Frericks, founded Strive-Asset Management firm based out of Ohio. Vivek claims that the largest asset managers (BlackRock, Vanguard) mix business with ESG politics to detriment the funds of their investors. Nonetheless, Vivek’s firm raised about $20 million from outside investors. In 2020, during the thick of COVID-19, Ramaswamy co-founded Chapter Medicare, a platform for those struggling through the lockdown. He served in the Ohio COVID-19 response team and did everything in his power to help the state get through the lockdown. Ramaswamy grew up as a genius scientist, and used his smarts to be successful in the business industry, ultimately aiming to better the community around him. In 2023, Ramaswamy stepped down at Roivant to pursue his presidential passions.</p>

        <h2>Politics</h2>
        <p>Ramaswamy has publicly said that he voted for the Libertarian party in the 2004 election,  and voted for Donal Trump in 2020. However, Vivek did not vote in the 2008, 2012, or 2016 elections, claiming he was apolitical during this time period. Ramaswamy has donated thousands to both the Republican and Democratic party, but he is currently running for the Republican party. Ramaswamy is striving to revive the American National identity. He plans to use military power to control the southern border, end affirmative action, and ban social media for children under 16 to accomplish this goal. Ramaswamy also wants to grow the US economy, specifically to get the country's GDP over 5 percent. He aspires to launch a “Reagan 2.0” type revolution by putting Americans back to work and incentivizing trade schools. Ramaswamy also aims to declare independence from communist China. He believes that if we hold the CCP accountable for COVID-19, stop them from buying American land, and use our military to eliminate Mexican drug cartels, his vision will be realized. Beyond that, Ramaswamy hopes to dismantle managerial bureaucracy. He believes that shutting down five agencies (FBI, ATF, IRS, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, USDA Food and Nutrition Service), eliminating federal unions, and ending “lazy” remote-work could accomplish this. In addition, Vivek wants to end the weaponization of government and financial markets. By acting to hold congress accountable for “hush money”, publish the Jeffery Epstein client list, and fight plans for digital currency, Ramaswamy believes we can best protect our citizens from government corruption. Ramaswamy is the only presidential candidate that has not publicly shamed Trump, even though they are running against each other. He argued that the social media bans on Trump violate the first amendment, rallied behind Trump after he was indicted on criminal charges, and promised to pardon him if elected as president. Ramaswamy also has said that he thinks the LGBTQ community is somewhat of a cult. He believes same-sex marriage is a “settled precedent”, but approves of broad restrictions on transgender rights. Ramaswamy has admitted that he is not a climate change denier, but he did say in his primary debate that “the climate change agenda is a hoax”. He thinks that the steps our current government is taking to combat climate change is corrupt, and that more people are suffering from the government’s newly made climate change policies than people actually dying from climate change itself.</p>
