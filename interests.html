        <h2>Roivant</h2>
        <p>Roivant is a pharmaceutical and healthcare organization founded by Vivek Ramaswamy that is a big part of Ramaswamy’s 2024 presidential campaign. Although Ramaswamy is no longer the CEO, Roivant’s views still support his campaign and share many ideas with Ramaswamy. He claims that “in addition to the success we have achieved in launching new Vants and in pursuing development of a variety of drugs, one of our most important achievements has been the growth of Roivant itself as a platform to support the efficient identification and advancement of medicines across all of the companies in the Roivant family.” Ramaswamy’s commitment to healthcare reform and his innovative approaches on how to reform healthcare aligns with Roivant’s mission of improving the delivery of healthcare. If he were to be President, Ramaswamy’s extensive background in pharmaceutical companies allows him to use his experience to take control of healthcare and transform policy surrounding it. Roivant believes that under his leadership, there will be opportunities to create a more patient-centric and efficient healthcare system, making quality medical treatment accessible to all Americans.

        <h2>American Exceptionalism PAC</h2>
        <p>The American Exceptionalism PAC claims that we must rediscover what America is. They support Ramaswamy’s America First 2.0 campaign to tackle the most pressing issues facing America today, including revamping our national American identity, transforming our economy, declaring independence from communist China, and more. He stated in a recent speech that “The best measure of the health of American democracy is the percentage of people who feel free to say what we actually think in public.” This PAC agrees that we should collectively make change to become a more united nation rather than a divided one. Records show that billionaire Glenn Dubin donated $100,000 to the American Exceptionalism PAC in support of Ramaswamy. This donation of $100,000 makes up almost one-fifth of the donations brought in by the American Exceptionalism PAC since February. With the help of donations like these, according to advertisement agencies, the American Exceptionalism PAC has spent $484,000 on advertisements for Ramaswamy. However, Ramaswamy’s amount of advertisement support is dwarfed by the $92,900,000 that has been spent by other GOP groups and candidates on advertisements. The PAC has also helped support Ramaswamy’s campaign moves in New Hampshire and Iowa, cementing them as one of Ramaswamy’s biggest supporters.</p>

        <h2>The Claremont Institute</h2>
        <p>The Claremont Institute’s mission statement is to “restore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, preeminent authority in our national life.” Their goals resonate deeply with Ramaswamy’s America First 2.0 policy guidelines to reinvent the American national identity. This think tank strives to return to the traditional American principles by teaching the foundational philosophies that led to the creation of a limited government. By teaching, writing, and litigating, those who are to take positions of power in the future will have in mind the foundation that America was built on. Ramaswamy’s campaign similarly plans on recognizing our history and values in order to strive for a better America. He believes that a strong sense of shared values is crucial for the progress of America, and plans on restoring traditional patriotism. Ramaswamy plans to end unlawful DEI indoctrination in order to reach the America he envisions, and would implement the teachings of traditional American philosophies, similar to The Claremont Institute. Furthermore, he plans on banning addictive social media under age 16 & gender confusion “care” for minors to complete his mission, which also ties into The Claremont Institute’s mission statement. He supports this by stating that “We’re in this to reach young people, to energize young people, and to do that, we can’t just hide.” Both The Claremont Institute think tank and Vivek Ramaswamy aim to bring back traditional American ideals in order to recover the American National Identity.</p>

        <h2>The Hudson Institute</h2>
        <p>The Hudson Institute has ideals that align very closely with those of Ramswamy’s, specifically with ideals regarding China. The institute actually just launched a new China center, with former secretary of state Michael Pompeo serving as the chair of the center's advisory board. He claimed how  “To have a China Center at Hudson, led by Miles, is a big step forward in fostering democracy’s cause against the central threat of our times: that is the Chinese communist model of governance,”. Just like Husom, Vivek has also publicly outed China saying how “We have to declare economic independence from China,”. Hudson was originally founded to tackle existential threats to America, and the biggest threat right now is communist China. Vivek has claimed that declaring independence from China is at the top of his priority list. He wants to hold the CCP accountable forCovid-19, and use all financial levers to do so. He also wants to stop the CCP from buying American land and ban U.S. business from expanding in China until the CCP stops cheating .Finally, he wants to use military force to annihilate against the CCP’s opium war. Both the Hudson Institute, (seen with the new addition of their China center) and Vivek Ramswamy, have publicly stated their disapproval of Communist China and are both currently doing everything in their power to put an end to the country's threat to America.</p>

        <h2>The Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism</h2>
        <p>The goal of the Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism is to make capitalism work for everyone to create a more stable and better future for all. Their goal aligns with Ramaswamy’s Truth 8 that states that “Capitalism lifts people up from poverty.” Ramaswamy as president would aim to maximize capitalism as he believes that capitalism would benefit everyone, including the poor. The coalition wants the benefits of capitalism to be spread to everyone so that everyone has the chance to thrive. They believe that a capitalism that is inclusive can produce sustainable growth that empowers others and addresses the needs of society. It will empower everyone to participate in the economy as they would be daily compensated for their effort. This would open the door to any individual to see their potential and allow them to chase a dream regardless of their background. This would also create a sustainable economy that can last for many generations and not be unfair in garnering benefits at the expense of others. Vivek hopes to open up this door to capitalism and therefore the economy as he sees it as a win for everyone as more opportunities will be created for the people to leave an impact on economic matters in society.</p>
